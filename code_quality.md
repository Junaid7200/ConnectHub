# Code quality guidelines

## must follow instructions

### Components must be PascalCase

### Variables must be camelCase

### folder structure must be modular (eg: screens, components, redux)

### clean, resuable, and well-commented code

### Avoid redundant imports/assets

### Consistent naming schemes

### put all types in types/types.tsx. Do not make types in the file, put all in types/types.tsx and import from there

### Optimized rendering and smooth routing transitions along with responsive layout

### make sure the database (supabase backend) will perfectly map to all the frontend

### design the entire frontend first, then create the supabase backend, once the backend is ready, use redux in the project and get the data from the db and make it all work. DO NOT MAKE redundant get/post or anything requests, optimize as much as possible
